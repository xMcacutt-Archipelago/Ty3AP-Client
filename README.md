## Functionality

### The Tracker

When the tracker window is closed, holding T will still display it.

### Collectible Info
The collectible info window can be opened by clicking the archipelago logo in the top right of the screen and selecting Collectible Info.

It displays the descriptions of the position of each collectible in the game sorted by level, collectible, and index.

### Goal
The goal is to complete a number of missions and defeat the Quinking.

### Checks
#### Collectibles
- Gooboo Berries
- Kromium Orbs
- Steves
- Bilbies
- Picture Frames

#### Missions
Every mission is a check. Each mission falls into one of four categories: Story, Race, Bunyip, and Gunyip.
The number of missions required for the Quinking to becomes available depends on your yaml settings.

#### Shops
Each shop has random items with random prices.
Special currencies spent at shops will not be deducted meaning you never softlock buying the wrong item.

### Items
#### Rangs
Each chassis is its own item. There are also a set number of rang stones in the pool.

### Barriers
There are five main barriers throughout the apworld
1. Crabmersible - Unblocks the fence and allows you to drive around Southern Rivers
2. Sly - Unlocks every bunyip level in Southern Rivers
3. Duke - Unlocks every gunyip level in Southern Rivers and is a requirement for Kaka Boom Island and Cinder Canyon
4. Karlos - Unlocks every battle arena in the game
5. Southern Rivers Gate - Unblocks the entrance to the second overworld and spawns the portal to Cassopolis in new Burramudgee

#### Levels
Each of the five levels that are played as Ty will require their specific level check to become accessible.

#### Other
- Item Maps
- Gooboo Berries
- Bilbies
- Kromium Orbs
- Bunyip Upgrades

#### Junk
- Opals bags
- Heal

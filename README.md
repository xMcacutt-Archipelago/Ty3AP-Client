## Functionality
### Goal
The goal is to complete a number of missions and defeat the Quinking.

### Checks
#### Collectibles
- Gooboo Berries
- Kromium Orbs
- Steves
- Bilbies
- Picture Frames

#### Missions
Every mission is a check. Each mission falls into one of four categories: Story, Race, Bunyip, and Gunyip.
The number of missions required for the Quinking to becomes available depends on your yaml settings.

#### Shops
Each shop has random items with random prices.
Special currencies spent at shops will not be deducted meaning you never softlock buying the wrong item.

### Items
#### Rangs
Each chassis is its own item. There are also a set number of rang stones in the pool.

### Barriers
There are five main barriers throughout the apworld
1. Crabmersible - Unblocks the fence and allows you to drive around Southern Rivers
2. Sly - Unlocks every bunyip level in Southern Rivers
3. Duke - Unlocks every gunyip level in Southern Rivers and is a requirement for Kaka Boom Island and Cinder Canyon
4. Karlos - Unlocks every battle arena in the game
5. Southern Rivers Gate - Unblocks the entrance to the second overworld and spawns the portal to Cassopolis in new Burramudgee

#### Levels
Each of the five levels that are played as Ty will require their specific level check to become accessible.

#### Other
